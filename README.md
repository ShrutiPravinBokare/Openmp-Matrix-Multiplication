# Openmp-Matrix-Multiplication
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in many scientific and engineering applications. 
In this project, I have implemented a matrix multiplication algorithm using OpenMP to parallelize the computation across multiple threads. 
The focus is on demonstrating how parallel programming can significantly improve performance in HPC environments.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of OpenMP for parallel matrix multiplication in a shared memory environment. The implementation showcases the performance improvement achieved by parallelizing the computation across multiple threads.

## Prerequisites
- GCC compiler with OpenMP support
- Linux environment (recommended)
- Basic understanding of C programming and OpenMP

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShrutiPravinBokare/openmp-matrix-multiplication.git
